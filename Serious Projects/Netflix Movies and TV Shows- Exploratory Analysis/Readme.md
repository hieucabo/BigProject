# üé• Netflix Movies and TV Shows- Exploratory Analysis

*** 

## üìÖ **Data source**

I get the data from **Kaggle**. The data set present Netflix movies and TV shows released from 1954 to 2022. 

- [Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/code/surobhipal/netflix-movies-and-tv-shows-exploratory-analysis/data)

***

## üèÅ **Project objectives**

- Clean and analyse the data.
- Have an insight of the data set. 

## üßê **What I learned**

This is my second work after the capstone project from the Google Data Analytics course. 
That is I choose an easy project to remind me what to do and how I should start everything? 

- Learn to use ````lubridate```` and ````skimr```` packages.
- Checking the data set to see if it is ready for analyse.
- Analysing the data set. 
- Using ````ggplot```` for visualize.

## üëü **Let's get started**

I split this into 2 stages, the first stage is to analyse movies and the second one is about TV shows.

### Load the necessary library 

````r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(xlsx)
library(lubridate)
library(skimr)
````

### Import the dataset

````r
movies <- read.csv("~/RStudio File/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies/Best Movies Netflix.csv")
shows <- read.csv("~/RStudio File/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies/Best Shows Netflix.csv")
````

### Analyse Movies 

- **Preparing Data**

First, let's have a look of our data using ````glimpse()````.

````r

There are 15 genres and 35 production countries. Besides, let's rename the column for easier analyse.

````r
movies <- movies %>% 
  rename("title" = "TITLE",
         "release_year" = "RELEASE_YEAR",
         "imdb_score" = "SCORE" ,
         "imdb_votes" = "NUMBER_OF_VOTES",
         "duration" = "DURATION" ,
         "genre" = "MAIN_GENRE",

- Drama is by far the most common genre among the movies in our dataset.
- On the other hand, the genres of War, Animation, and Sports have the fewest number of movies.

- Most of the movies available on Netflix are from the United States (US), India (IN), and Great Britain (GB).

- It's noticeable that the top 3 countries with the most movies are among the most appearing on this list.
- Surprisingly, the genres of Documentary, Romance, and Crime, which are not among the top 3 genres, also appear in this list.

- Although the sci-fi genre has a relatively low number of movies in our dataset, it has the highest median score and median vote among all genres.
- The horror and animation genres have a large number of votes but generally do not receive high scores. On the other hand, the documentary and action genres have a high average score (7.8) but a relatively low number of votes.
- The musical genre has both the lowest median score and the fewest median votes among all genres.

````

- Out of the top 5 movies ranked by IMDb score, two are from Great Britain, two are from the United States, and the 
last one is from India. Interestingly, the top 2 movies are not from the popular genres.
 
Because there is only 1 drama movie on the list while the drama genre has the most movies, I want to take a deeper look at this genre.

````r
movies %>% 
  select(title,imdb_score, release_year,country, genre) %>% 
  filter(genre == "drama") %>% 
  arrange(desc(imdb_score)) %>% 
  slice(1:5)

3 Once Upon a Time in America        8.3         1984      US drama
4         Like Stars on Earth        8.3         2007      IN drama
5           Full Metal Jacket        8.3         1987      GB drama
````

It seems that most of the movies in the top 5 are quite old, with 4 out of 5 having been released before 2000. How about movies after 2000?

````r
movies %>% 
  select(title,imdb_score, release_year,country, genre) %>% 
  filter(genre == "drama", release_year > 2000) %>% 
  arrange(desc(imdb_score)) %>% 
  slice(1:5)
````

````r

1   Like Stars on Earth        8.3         2007      IN drama
2               Warrior        8.2         2011      US drama
3                 Queen        8.2         2014      IN drama
4      Paan Singh Tomar        8.2         2012      IN drama
5 Miracle in Cell No. 7        8.2         2019      TR drama
````

That's an interesting observation! It seems that since 2000, Indian drama movies have been particularly well-received, with three of them appearing in the top 5 drama movies based on IMDb scores.
