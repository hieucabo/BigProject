# 📊 Data Visualization

Hello guys, I would like to introduce that I am not a creative person ✏️. I am more of a logical person 🤯. 

This is probably not a showcase of the best dashboards, sorry for letting you guy down. But believed me, I'll try my best to improve my visual skills.

I will consider this as a place to store the development process of
a person who is not good at creativity (images, colors, content, . ..) to become a person who can create the best dashboards.

There will be a time when I create the dashboard if you want to know my process.

- Action games are the most popular, followed by sports and shooters.
- NA (North America) has the highest number of games sold, 
accounting for nearly 50% of the total sales.
- Released in 2006, Wii Sports is still the most favorite game.
- Nintendo is the publisher with the most games sold. 
However, the platform that had in the most game sales is Sony's, Play Station 2.

- 12 p.m. is the peak time for pizza orders.
- Classic Deluxe Pizza was the most popular, but the Thai Chicken Pizza brought in the highest revenue.
- Brie Carre Pizza had the lowest sales, possibly due to limited size options compared to other pizzas.
- The least number of pizzas were ordered at 9:00, 10:00, and 23:00. This data could be useful for optimizing store operations and reducing facility costs. Perhaps the store could open later or close earlier during these low-traffic hours.
