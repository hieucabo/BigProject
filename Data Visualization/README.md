# 📊 Data Visualization

Hello guys, I would like to introduce that I am not a creative person ✏️. I am more of a logical person 🤯. 

This is probably not a showcase of the best dashboards, sorry for letting you guy down. But believed me, I'll try my best to improve my visual skills.

I will consider this as a place to store the development process of
a person who is not good at creativity (images, colors, content, . ..) to become a person who can create the best dashboards.

There will be a time when I create the dashboard if you want to know my process.
