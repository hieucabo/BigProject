# 📊 Data Visualization

Hello guys, I would like to introduce that I am not a creative person ✏️. I am more of a logical person 🤯. 

This is probably not a showcase of the best dashboards, sorry for letting you guy down. But believed me, I'll try my best to improve my visual skills.

I will consider this as a place to store the development process of
a person who is not good at creativity (images, colors, content, . ..) to become a person who can create the best dashboards.

There will be a time when I create the dashboard if you want to know my process.

- Action games are the most popular, followed by sports and shooters.
- NA (North America) has the highest number of games sold, 
accounting for nearly 50% of the total sales.
- Released in 2006, Wii Sports is still the most favorite game.
- Nintendo is the publisher with the most games sold. 
However, the platform that had in the most game sales is Sony's, Play Station 2.

## Walmart Sales

- April and July had the most sales.
- There's about 5% differences in sales for the most sales quarter (quarter 3) and the least sales quarter (quarter 1).
- Store ID 20, 4 and 14 were the top 3 stores by ID.
- There's 4 holidays, **Super Bowl**, **Labour Day**, **Thanksgiving** and **Christmas**. Only Christmas has a big difference compared to the other 3 days.

## Pizza Place Sales

- 📅 [Here is the dataset](https://app.mavenanalytics.io/datasets)

- 12 p.m. is the peak time for pizza orders.
- Classic Deluxe Pizza was the most popular, but the Thai Chicken Pizza brought in the highest revenue.
- Brie Carre Pizza had the lowest sales, possibly due to limited size options compared to other pizzas.
- The least number of pizzas were ordered at 9:00, 10:00, and 23:00. This data could be useful for optimizing store operations and reducing facility costs. Perhaps the store could open later or close earlier during these low-traffic hours.

## Maven Slopes Challenge Ski Resorts

- 📅 [Here is the dataset](https://github.com/hieucabo/Selfstudy-Project/tree/main/Serious%20Projects/Maven%20Slopes%20Challenge)

- There are "unknown" values in the data set, so I had to prepare it before using it for visualize. You can find my work on the link above.
- Because this is an interactive dashboard, so I will put 2 images to show how differences between the original and the dashboard after the filter.

- To make the dashboard as user-friendly as possible, I incorporated several filters, slicers, and bookmarks to provide skiers with a personalized list of the best resorts. 
- Using bookmarks and buttons for the first time.
